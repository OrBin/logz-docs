### About array fields

Arrays are not natively supported in Kibana.
When an array is included in a log, the full array is displayed as a single field marked with the <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i> icon next to the field name, as in the image below.

You can seach values inside the array as in the filter syntax example below.
