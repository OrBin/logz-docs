// The current doc does not give the customer any info on what will determine an exception\how our system catches exceptions and adds them

// Yuval explains the difference between Cognitive and Application insights. We need to add this explanation in as well

Logz.io Insights Engine automatically surfaces exceptions and highlights them in your log results.

As you're troubleshooting in Kibana Discover, you can easily see the number of exceptions identified in your log results for every query you run. The list is always in-context, and specific to the log results returned by your search.

To review exceptions affecting your environments, switch to the **Exceptions** tab and expand the documents that interest you.

# How an exception is determined

How does Logz.io catch and add an exception?

# Cognitive vs. application insights

for each programming language we support -> there is different  exception pattern list that is configured here: https://github.com/logzio/configurations/blob/851495982bcd7e6519e6566731a6d44f7a332e8e/common/config.conf#L456-L650

We have 2 types of insights:
Cognitive Insight
Application Insight (the new name is Exceptions)
 The Cognitive Insight is when one of the account log contain special words which linked in our system to known issue so we provide some links and meta data related to this issue
The Application Insight (Exceptions) Is when one of the logs contain words which implements that the user have errors in the code ( for example: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5 )
the Exceptions tab show only Application Insight so they wonâ€™t see the Cognitive insight that you shown in the picture (edited) 



### Exception count
To help you stay focused, the list is capped and will always show the top 10 exceptions.
If there are more exceptions than can be shown, you can fetch the **Most frequent** or **Most recent** exceptions.

* **Most frequent** - Most number of occurrences in the given time frame.
* **Most recent** - Most recently occurred within your selected time frame.

### Investigating an exception

The same exception may recur in different log lines, with slight variations. Sometimes, they may even appear as clones.

Logz.io tracks the recurrence of each exception over time, and retains its **First occurrence**, that is the earliest time the exception was identified. The history of exceptions can date back up to 6 months.

|---|---|
|Exception| Concise title auto-detected by Logz.io based on the contents of the logs |
|Tag| Descriptive tags auto-detected by Logz.io that describe the exception type |
|Log types| A list of all the log types found to be affected by the exception |
|# of occurrences| The number of times logs associated with this exception were spotted in the given time frame |
|First occurrence| The earliest time the exception was identified |
| Last seen | Most recent occurrence of the exception, based on your browser's time zone |

### Sorting & Filtering options

By default, exceptions are sorted by their frequency (that is, their number of occurrences).

To reorder exceptions by **# of occurrences**, **First occurrence**, or **Last seen**, click the column header to sort the data in ascending/descending order. (An arrow indicates the sorting method.)



### New exceptions

Exceptions that occurred for the first time within the search time frame are tagged as **New** exceptions.
