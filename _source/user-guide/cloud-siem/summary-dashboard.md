The **Summary** dashboard is the default screen that you can see when accessing your SIEM account. 

To check what events have occurred in the past 7 days on the **Summary** dashboard:

1. Sign in to Logz.io.

2. Go to **SIEM**. The default view shows a summary of events that occurred in the past 24 hours.

3. To change the default time frame, click the calendar icon in the top right corner of the screen and select **Commonly used - last 7 days**.
