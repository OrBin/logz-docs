### Choosing a dashboard

By default, when accessing your SIEM page, you will see the **Summary** dashboard. This dashboard shows you general information on your security events. You can request Logz.io to configure the default dashboard to your needs.

SIEM includes a number of dashboards dedicated specifically to a data source you may be using.

To access a dashboard:

1. Sign in to Logz.io.

2. Go to **SIEM > Dashboards**.

3. Search for the required dashboard.

4. Select the required dashboard from the list.

If you do not see the dashboard you require, contact the Logz.io support via the chat option in the bottom right corner of the screen.
