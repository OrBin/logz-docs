A protected rule is a rule defined by Logz.io. They appear in the **Rule definitions** list with a Logz.io rule tag. You cannot edit the name or logic of a protected rule. You can, however, define what accounts to apply the rule to, edit the trigger conditions, tags and recipient endpoints of a protected rule.

To edit a rule:

1. Sign in to Logz.io.

2. Go to **SIEM > Rules**.

3. Select the three dots menu on the right side of a rule that you need to edit.

4. Select **Edit**.

5. Edit the rule conditions. This is different for regular rules where you can edit any field and a protected rule where some fields are locked.
