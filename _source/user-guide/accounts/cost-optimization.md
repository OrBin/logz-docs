Logz.io offers a quick and intuitive way to optimize your Metrics and Logs account with just a few clicks. You can view your unused data and perform bulk actions to allow an optimized account.

To get started, navigate to **[Metrics > Data optimization hub](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/cost)**. Choose whether you'd like to review your Metrics or Logs account.

Next, you'll be able to see your current data and its usage, including: 

* Metric or log name and its related labels.
* Amount of Unique Time Series (UTS) or Volume in use.
* The accounts that are using the data.
* The context in which the data is being used; in an alert or as part of a dashboard.
* The actions you can take to optimize your usage.

#### Filter your view

You have two primary filters that you can apply to your view: **Account** and **Used**.

The Account filter includes all of the accounts associated with your user, and the Used filter allows you to get a quick view of how the data is being used.

You can also click on the account's name or one of the used options inside the table to apply them to your filters.

For example, you can apply the **Not used** filter to view all data not being used by any alerts or dashboards.

In addition, you can filter your view by clicking on the titles of the table to view by ascending or descending data.


#### Actions and abilities

After filtering your view and analyzing how much data you’re using, you can optimize your usage by dropping unnecessary data.

You can drop individual metrics or logs or perform a bulk-drop action by selecting several metrics or logs.

By selecting multiple lines from the table, a new **Drop** button will appear at the top of the table. Click on it to review all of the filters included in this process and estimate how much data you’ll save. Then, click **Drop** to drop these metrics or logs.
