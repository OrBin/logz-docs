Kubernetes' container orchestration infrastructure has numerous advantages for dev and ops teams; it provides service discovery and load balancing, allowing developer autonomy and business agility. 

**Kubernetes 360** by Logz.io removes the complexity and management difficulty often found when handling complex systems, giving you flexibility and visibility in a single, unified platform.

This platform allows monitoring application SLOs in a simple, efficient, and actionable manner while combining log analytics, Prometheus metrics monitoring, and distributed tracing provided by Jaeger.
