Deploy this integration to send Unified Audit Logging logs from Microsoft 365 to Logz.io. This method of log forwarding utilizes the Office/Microsoft 365 Management API, which currently supports the following Microsoft 365 content types:

* Audit.AzureActiveDirectory
* Audit.Exchange
* Audit.SharePoint
* Audit.General (includes all other workloads not included in the previous content types)
* DLP.All (DLP events only for all workloads)


**Before you begin, you'll need**: 

* An active subscription for Microsoft 365 with an appropriately provisioned administrator account.
* Unified Audit Logging enabled within M365’s [Security and Audit Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off?view=o365-worldwide#verify-the-auditing-status-for-your-organization)
* A machine for hosting filebeat version 7 or greater, preferably a Windows machine.

##### Register a new application in Azure AD

1. Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign-in with an administrative account.
2. Open the pop-out menu from the top left corner of the web page and click on **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Under the **Manage** section on the left-hand side of the page, select **App registrations > New registration**.
  ![New registration](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/siem/office365/new.png)
4. Name your app, and then adjust options as necessary. The default settings should be fine if working with a single M365 tenant without a URI proxy.
  
<!-- info-box-start:info -->
Take note of the Application (client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID. These will be used later when configuring Filebeat.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->

##### Create a client secret for your application

1. From your application overview, navigate to **Certificates & secrets**. A client secret will be needed for your Filebeat configuration in order to pull data from the management API.
2. Select **+ New client secret** and provide a description of your choosing.
3. Take note of the **Value** of the new client secret.

##### Adjust app permissions to allow for interaction with the management API


1. Navigate to **API Permissions** on the left hand side of the page, select **+ Add a permission** and scroll down to find  the “Office 365 Management APIs” widget.
2. From the **Application permissions** tab, enable the **ActivityFeed.Read** and **ActivityFeed.ReadDlp** permissions.

##### Configure Filebeat

1. Paste the following into the inputs section of the Filebeat configuration file:

   ```yaml
   filebeat.inputs:
   - type: o365audit
     application_id: <application ID>
     tenant_id: <tenant ID>
     client_secret: <client Secret>
   fields:
     logzio_codec: plain
     token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
     type: o365
   fields_under_root: true
   #For version 6.x and lower uncomment the line below and remove the line after it
   #filebeat.registry_file: 'C:\ProgramData\Filebeat'
   filebeat.registry.path: 'C:\ProgramData\filebeat'
   #The following processors are to ensure compatibility with version 7
   processors:
     - rename:
       fields:
     - from: "agent"
       to: "beat_agent"
       ignore_missing: true
     - rename:
       fields:
     - from: "log.file.path"
       to: "source"
       ignore_missing: true
############################# Output ##########################################
   output:
     logstash:
       hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
       ssl:  
           certificate_authorities: ['C:\ProgramData\filebeat\COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
           
   ```
  
   * {% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.md %}
   * {% include log-shipping/listener-var.md %}

2. Run Filebeat with the new configuration.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). You can filter for data of type `o365` to see the incoming Microsoft 365 logs.
  
If you still don’t see your data, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
